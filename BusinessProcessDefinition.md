For any company that wants to develop a project or product, they do not have any supporting system/tool to collect and manage the features.  The company must reach out to the stake holders either through email or meet in person to get the features they want and then prioritize them because there is no tool available to make this process more efficient. Any company that comes up with a new product must reach out to the stake holders to get the features they need - this is not an easy task. It takes a lot of time, people and money to accomplish this goal.

Our goal is to create a smart system that collects, prioritizes and organizes the features of any product from a customer.  This will ease the feature collecting process and also save time and money. This system will be initially built to handle one project/product.  Eventually, this system will be enhanced to handle multiple projects/products.

> # 2.0 Business Requirements #

> For products to have features that are highly desired by customers, producers must implement a system that captures the customer's needs/expectations they want from the product and also be able to manipulate and/or update the features as needed.

> ## 2.1 Process Flows ##
> ### 2.1.1 Existing or As Is Process Flow and Process Steps ###

When companies design and manufacture new products, consumer interaction or influence in the process is little to non-existent. Hence the reason why so many new products on the market struggle to prove profitable and leaves the customer unsatisfied because no one really asked the customer what "they" wanted in the first place!

The following is a typical flow-chart based on how most companies, which do not include customer interaction, come up with their products:

| **Step** | **Flow Diagram Element** | **Description** |
|:---------|:-------------------------|:----------------|
| 1 | Formulate new idea | A new idea is brought to the table for new products |
| 2 | Analyze potential market | The market is examined in order to predict the profitability of the product |
| 3 | Decision based on market potential | If the market seems to already have such a product, the idea is trashed and a new idea is formulated (Back to the drawing board, i.e. Step 1). If the decision based on the market potential is positive, the committee goes ahead with the idea |
| 4 | Build the prototype | A prototype of the product is created for demonstration to the committee |
| 5 | Consult mass manufacturing department | The manufacturing department gives their advice on how much the cost of production would be |
| 6 | Approval based on feasibility | If the cost of production seems reasonable, the company goes ahead with the plans of sale of the product and begins manufacturing. If not, it's back to the drawing board again (Step 1) |
| 7 | Set-up marketing plan | Deciding the price of the product according to the market and economy |
| 8 | Prepare for product launch | Funding for the advertising and search for advertising agencies begin |
| 9 | Market and advertise product | Product is unveiled to the public at consumer electronics trade show and it's advertising begins |
| 10 | Release product | The product is bought by and sent to the all the major consumer electronic stores |

| **Step** | **Flow Diagram Element** | **Description** |
|:---------|:-------------------------|:----------------|
|  1 | Start | Company Employee starts using the system |
|  2 | Search for Potential Customers | After potential customers are located and identified, a link to the Smart Online Feature Collaboration System is sent along with a temporary Username and Password which will expire when the features have been finalized |
|  3 | Meeting with Employees & Customers | A meeting is scheduled & held |
|  4 | Discuss product & it's features | Employees present the product to be developed and explain the basic product related functions |
|  5 | Collect features from potential customers | The eligible customers will sign-in with their temporary Username & Password for the intention of collecting the consumers feature suggestions |
|  6 | End meeting for feature organization | After the feature collection session, the employees end the meeting for the purpose of carefully organizing and prioritizing the features |
|  7 | Schedule another meeting | A meeting is scheduled & held once again |
|  8 | Present the organized features | The system presents the features of the product based on the descending priority of necessity set by the employees and customers |
|  9 | Decision to Agree/Disagree | After the previous step, the attendees come to a conclusion of whether the features seem satisfactory or otherwise.   In case of the former decision, meeting head prompts the system to save/finalize the features (Step 10). In case of the latter decision, attendees add or edit the features |
|  10 | Save to database and send | The features will be saved/finalized so that no more changes can be brought about. This list of features will be send to all the required employees (e.g. managerial & engineering department) assigned within the system via e-mail. |
