### Interview Notes ###
  * Q1. If the company has a customer feedback system, how does it work?

> After every purchase the customer makes to buy our products, we ask for their e-mail address, so that we can send them an online feedback form or a questionnaire. Questions could range from the satisfaction of the pricing of the product and the product features and the product as a whole.

  * Q2. What is the process for handling the feedback into project/product development?

> When we receive the completed questionnaire from the customer, we make offers on our other products and even the accessories related to the product. Sometimes if relevant, we also send the feedback to the developer if it is negative.

  * Q3. Briefly explain the smart feature organizer concept and ask if the company would purchase it.

> Yes, this is one way of letting the customer population get to "know" about the product before the marketing process and even before the product development begins.

  * Q3.1 What problem will our product help them to solve?

> The implementation of this product would help us save time and plenty of paperwork and reach the customer with the right finished product since a vast majority of consumer products don't attain the customer satisfaction since some or the other minute detail was over-looked.

  * Q3.2 Ask if the product would enable to find out the customerâ€™s needs?

> Most definitely, yes. Since you just explained how the system will work, there is customer involvement. We value customers and the customer is always right, therefore this will enable us to make the right product.

  * Q3.3 How would they use the product if they could mold it according to their expectations/needs?

> It is too early to say that since we do not have the "complete" picture of the product. If we were using the product, then we would have a general idea of what could be done to improve this system.

  * Q3.4 What value would you put on our product?

> Since the system does not seem to be too complicated, a fair price could range anywhere from $50 to $100. But if your product makes a lot of money, I would jack-up the price since you'll notice an increasing demand for it.

  * Q3.5 Would this product enable the company to have better relations with its customers?

> Yes, the system will enable the stakeholders to have a direct approach with the customers hence improving the customer to company relationship.
