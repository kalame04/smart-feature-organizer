# Project Name #
> Smart Online Feature Collaboration System

# Company Background/Business Plan #

> For every company to be profitable in the long run, it is crucial for their products to meet the standards of the customer. Our company specializes in this area. Numerous studies based on new product adoption, indicate that 70-80% of all new products fail. No matter how much expertise is involved in the development of a product, it is ultimately the consumer’s judgment that initiates a demand for it. Our goal is to create a smart system that collects and organizes the features of any product captured from the customer. This can help avoid miscommunication, minimize oversights, save time documenting, and most of all, provide a way to make sure that all of the features that the customer needs have been captured and agreed upon by both parties.

# Project Overview #

> In a demanding world, meeting with a customer and getting the features of a new product from them can become a tedious job. There can be problems such as miscommunication, oversights of what is needed for the final product, or the customer can change their mind constantly as to what is required. Our solution is the Smart Online Feature Collaboration system.  This system can be used during customer meetings to capture/retrieve the features, organize them, prioritize them and generate a document during the meeting itself. Now, both parties can agree upon the required features from a single document which has been generated from this system.
